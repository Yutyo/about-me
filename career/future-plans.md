## How i do my computing

I have a laptop,Acer Aspire V3-772G : Intel Core i5-4200M, NVIDIA GeForce 750M, 12 GB DDR3 Memory and Samsung SSD 850, and an Android Phone Samsung Galaxy J2 SM-J200F.

## About applications

    Mostly i use free software both on my laptop and phone. Some applications are non-free but i dont't use them for my projects only to join some software related groups.

## My Education and Career

    I graduated Economics in [Bilecik Şeyh Edebali University](http://bilecik.edu.tr/) and then attended courses at [Bilişim Eğitim](http://www.bilisimegitim.com/) for Windows System Administration and Cisco Network after that courses i wanted to learn programming and attended courses at [C and System Programmers Association](http://www.csystem.org/) for Assembly ( nasm and some gnu assembly ) , C and System Programming. 

    My main interest is System programming , for the meaning of System programming please have a look at :

1. [Systems programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_programming)
2. [Who is the system programmer](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/zosbasics/com.ibm.zos.zmainframe/zconc_sysprogrole.htm)

I started a service for "Internet Technologies" and Web Programming(HTML,CSS,JS,Bootstrap,PHP,Laravel),Wordpress,OpenCart and other web applications.

## What i need to make my computing experience better

I need to learn how to search official articles from providers and other articles which is tested and has secure information. I need to study official books about Computing Science and educational videos, presentations.

## About Services

My priority is to customize WordPress and Opencart and make them ready to use by enterprise corporates but i accept demands that is related with PHP and Laravel framework also.After that technologies i'll study Python and Django and maybe other web programming languages and frameworks.

I need to learn storage services, LDAP, network administration, database administration and topics related with general server administration.

## What devices i need for to make my computing experience better

I need a test server running Linux kernel and another test server with Coreboot and Linux-libre kernel to learn how kernel interacts with computer deeply.

I don't need another laptop or smart phone because i think it is waste of money.
