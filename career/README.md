My first computer job was at [Teleperformance](https://www.teleperformance.com/tr-tr/) call center [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/tr-tr/) department. I worked at Sales , Product Activation and Twitter support teams. Then i joined [Lenovo](https://www.lenovo.com/tr/tr/) department gave support for Lenovo hardware.

Now i work for my own projects and join free and open source projects , create issues , ask questions and get help from the maintainers.
